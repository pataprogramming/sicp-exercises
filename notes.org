* Notes
** Section 2.2, page 134

The previous sentence of Perlis's comment in the footnote is often
missed out, presumably due to its reference to Pascal. The sentiment,
though, is more general. It's interesting to see how this has been
embraced by Rich Hickey.

"In Pascal the plethora of declarable data structures induces a
specialization within functions that inhibits and penalizes casual
cooperation. It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data
structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.

This makes me think more closely about lenses, particularly in my
BASIC implementation. Why should a function need to know how to find
the sub-structure that it is going to operate on? Perhaps this should
be supplied via a lens and an indirection.
